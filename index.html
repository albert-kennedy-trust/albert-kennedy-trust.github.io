                        My home life had always been quite complex and after leaving University unexpectedly, I decided that I didn’t want to return 
                        home but instead moved to Manchester where my partner lived.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In Manchester, I found myself feeling very adrift and isolated. I came to AKT as I felt like I had nobody to talk to and as an LGBT 
                        organisation I felt confident that they would understand and be able to help me with the problems I was having at the time.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        AKT helped me by getting me involved in the mentoring scheme. This was a big thing for me as it gave me somebody to talk to about all of 
                        the things that were going on in my life and I felt as though I could talk to somebody who wouldn’t judge me or my experiences. The mentoring 
                        scheme basically gave me someone who understood what I was going through, something that I felt I did not have in Manchester.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Along with my mentor, I saw my worker at AKT once a week as well. She gave me the opportunity to talk about what had happened since our 
                        last meetings. She helped keep me positive about getting things organised when I felt as though I was not getting anywhere. She would offer 
                        me emotional support and would always ask me how I was feeling and talk about my mental health with me and if I had any concerns about
                        anything else in my life.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Whilst I worked with AKT, I organised a temporary tenancy for myself in one of the local University Halls of residence before my partner 
                        and I decided that we were going to move to London. The move happened very quickly and I felt supported by AKT in the sense that they gave 
                        me all the contact details for their offices in London and let them know that I was moving!
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Since working with AKT, I am proud to say that I feel much happier and confident in myself, I have successfully moved to London and 
                        have an interview for a degree at University in the next few weeks that I am thrilled about.

                      <p>
                        When I was 16, my family relocated to the UK to escape the racism we faced elsewhere in Europe. We came to London and settled there. 
                        My parents are religious people and I was brought up in a very strict household. As a son I was expected to help discipline my sisters, 
                        and was beaten when I refused to join my father in being violent to them.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I didn’t come out to my parents myself: my sister told them I was gay, and that’s when my real problems started. My parents would not 
                        accept my sexuality. They threatened and punished me. They told me I had to give up being who I was or they would make sure that I lived 
                        a worthless life. My father told me he would pray to God to make me mad, so that I would never be happy or have anything of my own.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I couldn’t stay at home. I tried to get help from social services and the police, but they spoke to my parents and believed the lies 
                        they told them. Finally my parents threatened to send me to Nigeria for a ‘cure’. I was so frightened I left home as soon as I could and 
                        found a place to crash for a short while. I got in touch with an LGBT youth group which referred me to a charity called ‘The Albert Kennedy Trust’.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        AKT knew I was entitled to support from the start and even gave me some clothes and money for food, as I had nothing. Social services 
                        said they could help me only for a short time, as I needed to be on benefits for in the long term. However, the benefits office refused 
                        my claims as they said I hadn’t been in the UK long enough to qualify for help. Finally, after a long day being referred back and forth 
                        between social services and Connexions, I was sent to the housing office and given a place to stay.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        But on my 18th birthday, social services withdrew all their support, including my rent. I was given a notice to move out, and social 
                        services told me to return home, leave college or find a job. I had a tough time. AKT found a lawyer who carried on arguing my case for 
                        social services to keep supporting me. They also gave me money for food and travel. AKT and some teachers from my college supported me 
                        so I could stay in education. AKT also found me a mentor, someone I could talk to and who helped me deal with everything that was going on.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        My case is now closed with social services, since my benefits claim came through. My lawyer argues that I am entitled to support until 
                        I’m 21 but social services have refused to comment on that. I am still in touch with the AKT. I get advice and additional support from them, 
                        including exam fees. I am happy that I chose to stay in education as it means that I won’t be in a vulnerable situation in future. While I 
                        studied I also volunteered for AKT , helping out at Prides, with training and recruitment. I found it particularly satisfying to train housing 
                        officers on how they can address the homelessness which many LGBT young people face, based on my own experiences.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Even though this time was really hard for me, I carried on studying, partly out of a desire to prove my parents wrong. They told me I 
                        would not amount to anything, that I would be unhappy and deserved nothing out of life. But my predicted grades are As and A*s, and I have 
                        an offer from a top university to read Law next year. I am revising for my A-levels now. They’re in a couple of weeks.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        AKT has helped me to apply for student finance as an independent student, so that I’m not reliant on my parents and can study without 
                        worrying, just like any other student. I can even talk to my mentor about relationships. AKT are like my gay parents. They understand me 
                        and give me solid advice.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In future I hope to practice Human Rights law so that I can help other people to exercise their right to a life without violence or fear. 
                        My big ambition is to work for the UN and join others in trying to establish universal global human rights. Even though this may seem like 
                        a dream, I have learned that it is worth struggling against the odds.
