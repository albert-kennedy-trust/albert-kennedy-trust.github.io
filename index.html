                          My home life had always been quite complex and after leaving University unexpectedly, I decided that I didn’t want to return home but instead moved to Manchester.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I found myself feeling very adrift and isolated. I came to AKT as I felt like I had nobody to talk to and as an LGBT organisation I felt confident that they would understand and be able to help me with the problems I was having at the time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          AKT helped me by getting me involved in the mentoring scheme. This was a big thing for me as it gave me somebody to talk to about all of the things that were going on in my life and I felt as though I could talk to somebody who wouldn’t judge me or my experiences. The mentoring scheme basically gave me someone who understood what I was going through, something that I felt I did not have in Manchester.

                        <p>
                          Since working with AKT, I am proud to say that I feel much happier and confident in myself, I have successfully moved to London and have an interview for a degree at University in the next few weeks that I am thrilled about.

              <h3>Our history</h3>
              <p>
                Albert Kennedy was 16 years old when, on Sunday 30 April 1989, he tragically fell to his death from a multi-storey car park. Albert was very much loved by his family, but whilst spending some time in a children’s home he experienced rejection and homophobia from other residents, and sought solace in Manchester’s gay village.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cath Hall, a foster carer based in Manchester, was already aware of the rejection and ejection of young Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans (LGBT) people from their family homes and was spurred to action following this tragic death.
